# This program says hello and asks for my name
# By Brian F.

print('Hello!')
print('What is your name?') # ask for their name
name = input() # Store user input into name
print('Nice to meet you ' + name)
print('The length of your name is:')
print(len(name))
print('What is your age?') #ask for their age
age = input() # Store user input into age
print('You will be ' + str(int(age) + 1) + ' in a year!')

# I want to improve this program by adding checks to user inputs
# ensuring proper inputs. Also learning long commenting : )
