# PythonLearning
Progression of Python learning via simple programs to cool projects : P.  Each program name will end with a number. This number will signify what project it is I am working on. For instance, the file HelloWorld1.py indicates this is the first Python project I am working on. I intend on using this repository as a way to review my Python learning journey and I hope to demonstrate this to others as well! (P.S. I also feel this is a good way to grow more comfortable using Github : )     )
